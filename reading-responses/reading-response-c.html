      <i>ASCII text</i>

      "The reduction of language to the pulse-no pulse of zeroes and ones is a return to the <i>Sefer Yetzirah's</i> theme of a world created by the Infinite One, the <i>En Sof</i>."

    <h1>My Response</h1>
    <p>
      The excerpt above, taken from the section in the article that discusses ASCII texts, resonated with me due to the vivid and divine imagery that it depicts.  In transitioning from the discussion on ancient Hebrew Scriptures to the definitively more modern ASCII character sets, Ellison's comparison of two seemingly unrelated ideas, separated by millenia, through letters and the theme of <i>allness</i> or <i>oneness</i> and <i>nothingness</i> or <i>zeroness</i> proves especially interesting.
